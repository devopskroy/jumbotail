Write a docker file to build a jenkins agent container which can build java applications. It
should also have a helm , aws cli, maven preinstalled. Use the best practices of writing
docker file.

# Use a base image
FROM jenkins/jnlp-agent

# Install Java
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-jre

# Install Maven
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y maven

# Install Helm
# (Add Helm installation steps)

# Install AWS CLI
# (Add AWS CLI installation steps)

2. Advanced Infrastructure as Code (IAC):
- Need to create a dynamoDB table in the test and production environment . Create
terraform module to implement that

Use Terraform to provision Kubernetes cluster infrastructure.
- Implement infrastructure automation for scaling and high availability of nodes and node
groups.
- Include a disaster recovery plan in case of infrastructure failures.

3. Kubernetes deployment :
- Implement a canary deployment strategy in k8s
- Implement istio service mesh.
- Implement logging and monitoring solution


Canary deployments involve rolling out new application versions gradually to a subset of users. Kubernetes provides several options for canary deployments. One common approach is using Helm charts in combination with custom resource definitions (CRDs) or tools like Flagger for more advanced canary deployments.

Here's a high-level guide on how to set up a canary deployment using Flagger:

Install Flagger and configure it to work with your Kubernetes cluster.
Create a Kubernetes Deployment or StatefulSet for your application.
Define a Canary CRD with specific traffic routing and analysis rules.
Flagger will automate the deployment process, scaling up the new version while scaling down the old version if the new version meets specified criteria.


# Implementing Istio Service Mesh:

Istio is a popular service mesh that can be integrated with Kubernetes to provide features like traffic management, security, and observability.

To implement Istio:

Install Istio using Helm or the official Istio installation methods.
Deploy the Istio control plane and data plane components.
Label namespaces and services to enable automatic sidecar injection.
Configure traffic management rules using Istio's VirtualService and DestinationRule resources to control traffic routing, fault injection, and retries.
Set up security policies using Istio's AuthorizationPolicy to define access control for services.


#Implement Logging and Monitoring:

For logging and monitoring solutions, consider using the following tools:

Prometheus: Deploy Prometheus for monitoring your Kubernetes cluster and applications. Use Prometheus operators to make setup and management easier.

Grafana: Grafana can be integrated with Prometheus for creating dashboards and visualizing monitoring data.

Elasticsearch and Kibana: For centralized logging, use Elasticsearch for log storage and Kibana for log visualization.

Fluentd or Fluent Bit: Implement log collection agents like Fluentd or Fluent Bit to collect logs from containers and send them to the centralized logging system.

Jaeger: Jaeger is useful for distributed tracing, allowing you to analyze the flow of requests through microservices.

Alerting: Set up alerting with tools like Prometheus Alertmanager to receive notifications when metrics or conditions exceed predefined thresholds.

Kubernetes Operators: Consider using Kubernetes operators like the Operator Framework to automate the management of logging and monitoring components.

Advanced Continuous Integration (CICD):
- Set up a CICD server in k8s (helm chart only)
- Implement a pipeline that builds Docker images for each service and pushes them to a
private container registry.
- Automate the versioning of Docker images based on code changes.
